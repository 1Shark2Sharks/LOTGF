The **Blackthorn Security Company** is a front organization for the [[Tingen City|Tingen]] branch of the [[Nighthawks]], under the [[Church of the Evernight Goddess]]. The company operates out of the second floor of No. 36 Zouteland Street in [[Tingen City]], [[Loen Kingdom]]

Officially, it is known to the public as the "Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department, Awwa County Police, Loen Kingdom."

### Characteristics

The Blackthorn Security Company is responsible for addressing supernatural incidents related to followers of the [[Evernight Goddess]] in [[Tingen City|Tingen]]. They are mainly in charge of places like the north, west, and the Golden Indus region.

They occasionally accept commissions from passersby who request security services.

### Operations

Their operations take place beneath the company building, with a concealed passage connecting directly to the [[Saint Selena Cathedral]] and the [[Chanis Gate]].

Every newly promoted official member must complete a mission independently. This is merely a ritual among Nighthawks. It does not affect a salary, rights, or obligations. However, it is an important step in earning the recognition of other Nighthawks.

#### Side Jobs
Because of the cover identity of the Blackthorn Security Company, occasionally, some ordinary people come by to request services. As long as it doesn't interfere with regular duties, such requests are usually accepted. Any earnings would be considered additional bonuses.

Half of the commission would be handed to [[Orianna]] as additional funding for the team. The remaining would be split among members; however, unofficial members usually receive only about ten percent.
