**Sequence** is the basic hierarchical classification of [[Beyonder|Beyonders]] among the [[Pathway|Paths to the Divine]]. The higher the **Sequence**, the closer the Beyonder is to divinity and the greater abilities are manifested. The first and last **Sequences** are usually used as the name of their associated Pathway.

**Low-Sequence**: Sequences 9 and 8.
**Mid-Sequence**: Sequences 7 to 5.
**High-Sequence** (also known as **Demigods**): Sequences 4 to 1.

Each of the seven churches control one complete Sequence.
