**Sequence** is the basic hierarchical classification of [[Beyonder|Beyonders]] among the [[Pathway|Paths to the Divine]]. The higher the **Sequence**, the closer the Beyonder is to divinity and the greater abilities are manifested. The first and last **Sequences** are usually used as the name of their associated Pathway.

Each of the seven churches control one complete Sequence.
