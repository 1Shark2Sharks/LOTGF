There are 5 ways to lose control. The first was just stated. If a person who innately has partial [[Beyonder Characteristics]], they are chained to a specific path. If they consume another path’s potion, they will lose control. The third kind is if you go choose a [[Sequences]] and drink potions from another path, you will lose control. Fourth is if you consume a higher ranked potion without completely understanding the potion currently consumed, you will lose control. Finally, if they get enticed or bewitched, leading to greedy desires, they will start to lose control. And the Sequences prevent most of this from happening by providing a stable progression path.
