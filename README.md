# LOTGF - Library of the Gray Fog

An **spoiler-free Obsidian Vault** for *"Lord of the Mysteries"*.

---

## What Is This?

This vault serves two personal purposes:

1. **Avoid spoilers**: I was consistently encountering spoiled plot points when checking fandom wikis, so I built this as an alternative reference
2. **Structured note-taking**: Using AI-generated chapter summaries as a foundation, I created and linked custom notes to capture the details that matter to me

This is a genuine hobby project.

First release `CH_100_2026_MM_DD` will contain information from chapter 1 to ~100 with all associated materials including summaries and custom notes

Second release `CH_219_2026_MM_DD` will contain information from chapter 1 to 219 (End of Volume 1)

Third release `CH_300_2026_MM_DD` will contain information from chapter 1 to ~300\

and so on...


e.g. if you currently reading Chapter 120 of LOTM you should pull the latest `CH_100` release.

You should also install the Obsidian Community Plugin [Virtual Linker](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/02+-+Community+Expansions/02.05+All+Community+Expansions/Plugins/virtual-linker).
