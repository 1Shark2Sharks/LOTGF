# LOTGF - Library of the Gray Fog

An **spoiler-free Obsidian Vault** for *"Lord of the Mysteries"*.

---

## What Is This?

This vault serves two personal purposes:

1. **Avoid spoilers**: I was consistently encountering spoiled plot points when checking the LOTM Fandom Wiki, so I built this as an alternative reference
2. **Structured note-taking**: Using AI-generated chapter summaries as a foundation, I created and linked custom notes to capture the details that matter to me

This is a genuine hobby project.

## Releases

First release will be a pre-release `V1_CH-110` and will contain information from chapter 1 to ~110 with all associated materials including summaries and custom notes.

Second release will be the first full release `V1_CH_219_2026_MM_DD` and will contain all information from Volume 1 (first 219 Chapters). This release will probably get updates.

Third release will be again a pre-release `V2_CH_350`

Forth releas will bethe second full relase `V2_CH_482_2026_MM_DD`

...and so on...


e.g. if you currently reading Volume 1 Chapter 120 of LOTM you should pull the `V1_ CH_110` pre-release.
