Klein watches as Old Neil sets up a ritual and uses it to pray to the Evernight Goddess to help him settle a debt, as he is too broke. Later, Old Neil finds a rich person’s wallet, and gets 30 pounds out of it. At the same time, Audrey is at a ball, where she is practicing the acting method, going against her usual actions of being the center of attention to observing others. We also learn that Alger is pursuing someone from the Aurora Order, the Listener. We then get a POV from somebody from the Aurora Order’s son, whos father is most likely the Listener. Klein then gets his first customer, Anna, who is looking for her husband. Klein decided to use an astrolabe, which he learned earlier at the divination club. He divined the outcome of Joyce Meyer, and had a dream about maggots in a palace. Joyce was on a ship, when Nast, the King of the Five Seas, robbed him. An internal conflict broke out where Tris rallied the survivors against the other survivors, who had turned to murder. Klein returns home, and summarizes the many questions and theories that he has about his current situation, beyonder powers, and the world above the grey fog. Klein then created his honorific name, and started another Tarot club meeting. In the meeting, the members collected 3 of Roselle’s pages. There was also a lot of information about the Antigonus empire and their fall in the 4th epoch.
