After portraying himself to be on the level of the 7 major gods, Klein ends the Tarot meeting. Klein then gives Mr. Glacis another divination about an investment opportunity, which Mr. Glacis takes into account. Joyce Meyers then comes back again to get his dream divined, where it is revealed that Mr. Tris should be suspected of playing a big part in everyone going crazy on the ship. The next chapter confirms it. Tris is a Sequence 8 Instigator part of another secret organization called the Theosophy Order. At the same time, Alger and Audrey performed the ritual to Mr. Fool, which ended up working. Later, Klein was given some historical documents containing information about things such as secret orders and different beyonder pathways. The Secret Order, led by the Zarutul family, controls the Seer pathway. A lot of information about secret cults is organized in chapter 66. That night, Klein responded to the prayers of the Tarot club, and the next day, went with Old Neil to the underground market. Klein ran into a boy who was born with a half sequence of Monster, who noticed that Klein had died once. Klein also ran into another man buying the ingredients for the Spectator potion, though he didn’t do anything about it. He had also helped a girl pick out an amulet to give to her friend. The next day, after interacting with his family, Klein went to Chanis Gate with Dunn to pick up the 2-049.
