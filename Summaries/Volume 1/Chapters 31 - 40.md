#### Chapter 31: [[Beyonder Potions|Potion]]

  

[[Klein Moretti|Klein]] stands firm against [[Dunn Smith]]'s intense gaze, affirming his decision to consume the Seer potion despite its risks and lack of immediate mystical knowledge. Dunn, acknowledging Klein’s resolve, leads him underground to retrieve the Seer potion formula and materials from [[Chanis Gate]]. The journey through the cold, vast passageways heightens Klein's anxiety, leading him to question the origins of basic mystical knowledge—experimentation, divine bestowal, or dangerous murmurs that drive listeners mad.

  

Upon reaching the alchemy room, Dunn informs Klein he will fetch [[Old Neil]] for the potion ingredients while Klein remains behind due to his non-team member status. Old Neil arrives with a silver chest containing Seer potion materials and begins concocting the potion. The process is straightforward—measuring precise quantities of pure water, night vanilla extract, gold mint leaves, poison hemlock, dragon blood grass powder, Lavos Squid's blood, and Star Crystal, then mixing them in a cauldron without spiritual participation or incantations.

  

Old Neil emphasizes the critical nature of the last two ingredients—Lavos Squid’s blood and Star Crystal—warning that any deviation could lead to severe mental health issues or death. The mixture bubbles mysteriously, evoking a sense of familiarity for Klein. Once complete, Old Neil pours the dark-blue Seer potion into an opaque cup, signifying its readiness for consumption. Throughout this process, Dunn also reveals that their team has gained intel on the [[Secret Order]]'s activities, suggesting they will not provoke Klein in the near future due to uncertainties regarding an [[The Diary of the Antigonous Family|Antigonus Notebook]] significance to them.

#### Chapter 32: Spirit Vision

  

Klein, now under the tutelage of Old Neil, is about to consume a potion that will grant him the ability of spirit vision. The potion, dark-blue and gelatinous, requires unconventional preparations - drinking Intis Aurmir wine, smoking a Desi cigar, whistling a tune, dancing, and playing Gwent cards. After downing the potion, Klein experiences vivid hallucinations, with colors becoming more intense and his vision blurring. He recalls a similar experience during a luck enhancement ritual.

  

As the effects of the potion intensify, Klein's surroundings transform into a realm of ethereal objects and lustrous brilliances. Old Neil advises him to focus on a common object in his mind to manage the seepage of energy from the potion. Klein successfully visualizes his top hat, causing the chaotic murmurs and afterimages to subside. His eyes, upon examination, reveal a significant deepening, a physical manifestation of the potion's power.

  

Old Neil confirms Klein's transformation into a Beyonder, individuals with spiritual powers. He then guides Klein through the initial steps of Cogitation, a core ability in mysticism that allows control over one's spiritual energy. Old Neil explains that Cogitation involves focusing on non-physical aspects of self, starting with the Soul Body - the basic spirituality shared by all biological beings. Beyond this lies the Astral Projection, an external manifestation of the Soul Body used for communication with the spirit world and cosmos.

  

Old Neil further elaborates on the concept of Spirit Vision, a common ability among [[Seer Pathway|Seers]]. This involves seeing auras - external phenomena of one's Ether Body, representing vital energies and physical form. The colors of these auras signify different states of health and emotional conditions: red for limbs in motion or passion; purple for the head or prevailing emotions like coldness and estrangement; orange for waste excretion or warmth; yellow for happiness or extroversion; green for calm or peace; blue for thoughtful stillness; white for overall health. Thicker, darker colors indicate illness or exhaustion.

  

As Klein practices and stabilizes his [[Spirit Vision]], he notices Old Neil's aura, observing various colors reflecting his age and health. This realization solidifies Klein's new identity as a Beyonder. Despite initial skepticism, Old Neil encourages him to embrace this power, hinting at the vast potential of mysticism knowledge and abilities yet to be discovered.

#### Chapter 33: Switch

  

Klein, under Old Neil's tutelage, learns about Spirit Vision, an enhanced form of perception that reveals spiritual aspects of objects and beings. In the alchemy room, Klein discovers that objects without life lack spirituality, while those from extraordinary beings retain remnant spirits crucial for potion-making. Old Neil explains this concept and mentions a [[Sequence 9 - Corpse Collector]] potion requiring a desiccated black-spotted frog, emphasizing the courage needed to consume it.

  

Klein inquires about the absence of spirits and souls in the Nighthawk squad's headquarters beneath the [[Church of the Evernight Goddess|Church of Evernight]], learning that such a practice is controlled. Old Neil then explains common physical side-effects of Spirit Vision: glabella spasms, headaches, oversensitivity, and minor hallucinations. He advises Klein to develop a 'switch' to control its activation and duration—tapping his glabella twice activates it, while two more taps end it.

  

After practicing and mastering this method, Klein experiences fatigue from the mental strain. Old Neil reminds him of the importance of rest after using Spirit Vision excessively. He instructs Klein to visit Iron Cross Street later to seek clues about the [[The Diary of the Antigonous Family|Antigonus Notebook]].

  

On his way home, Dunn Smith congratulates Klein on being a suitable Beyonder candidate and warns him against probing unauthorized spiritual phenomena to avoid [[losing control]]. Upon returning home, Klein rests due to exhaustion from the day's activities.

  

Later that afternoon, Klein prepares for his Tarot Club meeting by using Spirit Vision to ensure no hidden spirits are present in his room. He then practices Astral Projection, a technique enabling him to leave his physical body and traverse the astral plane, guided by constellations. Despite initial discomfort, Klein successfully achieves this state with increasing self-control as a Beyonder.

#### Chapter 34: Advance Payment

  

In an underground basement devoid of windows, [[Alger Wilson]], a burly man with deep blue hair and lightning-patterned robe, conducts arcane rituals. He focuses on a sealed bottle containing tempestuous winds and swirling fog, his eyes turning dark as he prepares for an unknown process. Meanwhile, in [[Backlund]]'s Empress Borough, [[Audrey Hall]], a young woman with golden-tipped fountain pen, awaits the arrival of her mysterious guests. She practices writing down a formula from a blank notebook, her anticipation palpable.

  

Suddenly, a dark red and illusory beam erupts from Audrey's body, transporting her into a divine hall where two figures—[[The Fool]] (Klein) and The Hanged Man—await. Klein, enveloped in fog, greets them casually, while Audrey follows suit, addressing them as "Mr. Fool" and "Mr. Hanged Man." The Hanged Man's aura, visible to Klein due to their shared Beyonder status, reveals emotions of calm, thoughtfulness, and careful pleasure. Intrigued by this insight, Klein deduces that the Hanged Man is a potent Beyonder, possibly surpassing Old Neil in strength.

  

Alger Wilson completes his rituals, revealing himself as a skilled alchemist who has obtained [[Ghost Shark Blood]]—an extraordinary creature's essence—from Audrey's family vault. He thanks her for the quick delivery and proceeds to share the formula for a Low-Sequence potion with her:

  

* 80 milliliters of pure water

* 5 drops of autumn crocus essence

* 13 grams of cow teeth paeonol powder

* 7 petals of elf flowers

* A matured Manhal Fish's eyeball

* 35 milliliters of goat-horned black fish blood

  

Alger emphasizes the importance of precise measurements and warns against deviations that could lead to loss of control, a common danger among Beyonders. He also instructs Audrey on Cogitation, a practice that helps control one's spirituality and energy after consuming the potion.

  

As Alger explains, The Fool (Klein) interjects with cryptic advice: "[[Potion Digestion|Digesting]], acting... Digesting, acting... Digesting, acting, key." His words leave Audrey confused but intrigued, as they seem to hold great significance. Alger appears enlightened by this hint, thanking The Fool for his valuable insight.

  

Finally, Klein requests an advance payment from Audrey and Alger: to collect Emperor Roselle Gustav's secret diary on his behalf, even if only one page is obtained. This mysterious task sets the stage for future developments in their Beyonder pursuits.

#### Chapter 35: Exchange of Information

  

Klein Moretti, now known as The Fool, hosts a meeting with Alger and Audrey in his mysterious divine palace. They discuss the exchange of information regarding Emperor [[Roselle’s Diary]], written in a cryptic language or symbols believed to be a unique set of mystical symbols from mysticism or hieroglyphs. No one has been able to decipher it yet.

  

Klein suggests they try projecting thoughts onto a piece of paper using a fountain pen imbued with the desire to write urgently. Audrey, following his instructions, successfully writes a line from Emperor Roselle's poem: "If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind?" She expresses surprise and relief, understanding that they can memorize symbols or cryptic text and present it directly as needed.

  

Alger, intrigued by Klein's abilities, asks for more information about Spectators. Klein explains the core principle of a Spectator: maintaining absolute objectivity and neutrality in observing society and individuals to uncover their true thoughts through subtle clues like emotions secreted or smells given off.

  

As they delve deeper into the conversation, Alger shares news about Admiral [[Ludwell]], a pirate known for his Black Tulip ship, restarting his exploration of the eastern end of the [[Sonia Sea]]. Klein, considering this information valuable yet not exposing him, reveals that the [[Secret Order]] has lost an [[The Diary of the Antigonous Family|Antigonus Notebook]], which they believe was destroyed by the [[Church of the Evernight Goddess|Church of Evernight]].

  

Audrey shares a personal anecdote about learning to faint elegantly from her etiquette teacher as a practical skill for social situations. She also mentions that the king, premier, and gentlemen are under immense stress following the failure in the battle on Balam's eastern shore, wishing for significant changes.

  

Throughout the chapter, Klein continues to demonstrate his Beyonder abilities, including creating a divine palace and guiding others to project their thoughts onto paper as a medium of communication. The discussion sheds light on Emperor Roselle's mysterious diary, the Secret Order, and the Church of Evernight while exploring the concept of [[Sequence 9 - Spectator|Spectators]] and their role in uncovering hidden truths.
  

#### Chapter 36: A Simple Question

  

In [[Backlund]]'s Empress Borough, Audrey Hall meticulously writes down the formula for the Spectator potion on exquisite parchment. The ingredients include 80 milliliters of pure water, 5 drops of autumn crocus essence, 13 grams of cow teeth paeonol powder, 7 petals of elf flowers, and a matured Manhal Fish's eyeball, along with 35 milliliters of goat-horned black fish blood. She hides the true formula within seemingly complex chemical annotations to avoid detection. Audrey plans to gather the materials from her vaults or by exchange, resorting to seeking help from the Hanged Man or the Fool if necessary.

  

Meanwhile, in his dimly lit study, Klein contemplates his newfound abilities as a Beyonder. He recalls that he can summon another dark red star, potentially allowing him to contact another entity. However, he decides against it due to uncertainties about the identity and attitude of the newcomer. Klein is cautious because involving an "evil" organization like his in the eyes of the church could jeopardize his future.

  

Klein then meditates, focusing on his spirituality to return to reality. He awakens fully, noticing subtle differences between the [[Gray Fog]] and the [[Spirit World]]. After pondering his role as a Seer, he decides to use Spirit Vision for now, understanding that becoming one cannot be rushed.

  

In another part of Backlund, Alger Wilson, the Hanged Man, struggles to decipher how Klein summoned him and Justice through the gray fog. Despite his preparations, he remains puzzled by the Fool's method, staring at a goatskin parchment with the title "7. Seafarer" written in dark blue ink.
  

#### Chapter 37: The Club

  

Klein, feeling downcast after his failed attempt to retrace his steps regarding the Antigonus family's notebook, leaves his house on a hot afternoon. Wearing casual attire to avoid sweat contaminating his formal suit, he heads towards Iron Cross Street, an area divided into Left Street, Right Street, Upper Street, and Lower Street. Klein recalls the Antigonus family's notebook and its significance to the [[Nighthawks]], causing him distress.

  

Along the way, Klein encounters Mrs. Wendy Smyrin at her bakery. She offers him a newly created sweet iced tea, revealing she is a Southerner who moved to Tingen with her husband decades ago. They chat about local food preferences, and Klein appreciates the drink's refreshing taste, which alleviates his mood slightly.

  

As Klein approaches Iron Cross Street, he experiences an overwhelming sense of gloominess that he cannot pinpoint. Realizing this is due to activating his Spirit Vision in unfamiliar environments and being susceptible to others' emotions, he taps his glabella to regain control. He decides to search his old apartment for the missing notebook but finds no clues or spiritual entities.

  

Klein then recalls Old Neil's advice about practicing perception control and decides to investigate the [[Divination Club]], which he had seen on a signboard earlier. Upon entering, he learns that joining the club involves paying an annual fee of five pounds for the first year and one pound thereafter. Members gain access to divination tools, lectures from famous fortune-tellers, and a community of like-minded individuals. Klein contemplates the idea but ultimately decides not to join due to financial constraints, instead planning to explore alternative paths in his search for the Antigonus family's notebook.

#### Chapter 38: Novice Hobbyist

  

Klein seeks divination at the Divination Club, led by [[Hanass Vincent]], a renowned Tingen fortune-teller and club mentor. The club takes a small fee for using its members' services. Klein chooses Glacis, a novice tarot reader who charges two pence per session. Despite his inexperience, Glacis agrees to perform the divination for free.

  

The divination process involves Klein contemplating the location of an item—the Antigonus family's notebook—while shuffling and cutting a tarot deck. The first card drawn is The Fool, inverted, indicating the lost item cannot be found. A second attempt with The Star, also inverted, suggests the item hasn't been taken by others yet.

  

Klein pays Glacis two pence, despite the offer of a free reading, expressing respect for divination. Before leaving, Klein advises Glacis to consult a doctor about a dark glabella, which he misinterprets as a sign of lung trouble due to the dimly lit room. In reality, Glacis' glabella appeared dark because of the closed curtains.

  

Afterward, Klein plans to save money to join the Divination Club officially, allowing him to work as a Seer without street hawking. He visits Blackthorn Security Company and speaks with [[Leonard Mitchell]] about [[Welch McGovern|Welch]] and [[Naya]]'s suicides, attributing it to the unknown existence that forced him to hide the Antigonus family's notebook. Leonard questions why Klein wasn't made to destroy the notebook during their suicide attempt if silencing was the goal.

  

This chapter introduces the Divination Club, its members, and their divination methods using [[Tarot Cards]]. It also reveals more about the mysterious Antigonus family's notebook and Klein's strategic planning to join the club for future Seer work. The misinterpretation of Glacis' glabella color adds a comedic touch to the narrative, highlighting Klein's observational skills and willingness to offer advice even in unfamiliar situations.

#### Chapter 39: Interesting Trick

  

Klein, now aware of the mysterious circumstances surrounding his notebook's disappearance, engages in speculative reasoning with Leonard Mitchell. Klein posits that an unknown entity might have enjoyed the sacrifice of life and orchestrated his attempted suicide to ensure its continuation. This theory stems from his exposure to cult narratives in literature, movies, and TV dramas. Leonard, however, suggests another possibility: the notebook could be a vessel for evil, prompting Klein to conceal it before others discover and destroy it.

  

Klein remains wary of Leonard's motives and deflects suspicion by stating he has lost memories from that period, which [[Dunn Smith|Captain]] and [[Daly Simone|Madam Daly]] have already confirmed as harmless. Leonard, seemingly satisfied with Klein's response, shifts the conversation to the afternoon's events.

  

In the evening, Klein visits the Shooting Club's armory and archives, where he encounters [[Rozanne]] and [[Bredt]], a fellow Nighthawk member. Rozanne expresses curiosity about Klein's transformation into a Beyonder, now known as Seer, due to the Sequence potion he consumed. She also reveals that Bredt wishes to switch shifts with her for an evening of romance with his wife at the North Borough theater.

  

During practice, Klein focuses on mastering his shooting skills and physical fitness exercises. Upon returning home, he finds [[Melissa Moretti|Melissa]] has returned early from school, carrying groceries and explaining her decision to walk instead of taking public transportation due to cost savings. After a brief exchange, Klein persuades Melissa to use the saved money for their family's needs and her future education.

  

The following morning, Klein arrives at work to find [[Old Neil]] and Rozanne conversing near the reception desk. Old Neil playfully inquires if Klein heard anything unusual the previous night, to which Klein responds innocently. Old Neil then directs Klein to the armory for a mysticism lesson, hinting at an "interesting trick" involving a silver chain and moonstone pendant on his wrist.

#### Chapter 40: Mysticism Curriculum

  

Klein, now going by the name of Zhou Mingrui in this new world, engages in a mysticism lesson with Old Neil. Neil tasks him with preparing two cups of coffee, one with an "unpleasant" addition chosen by Klein, to demonstrate [[Pendulum]] dowsing—a form of [[Divination]] using a swinging object like a crystal or metal to receive answers from the [[Spirit World]].

  

After Old Neil leaves for his patrol of the armory, storeroom, and archives, Klein adds dirt from his boots to one cup, making it indistinguishable from the other. Upon Neil's return, he identifies the tainted cup by the pendulum's movement—counterclockwise indicating a negative result.

  

Old Neil then explains pendulum dowsing, detailing how it relies on the user's Astral Projection connecting with spiritual intelligence through objects like crystals or metals. The direction of the pendulum swing (clockwise for positive, counterclockwise for negative) is key to receiving answers. Klein expresses interest in learning more and considers purchasing materials for his own pendulum, but Neil suggests he apply for one directly as it's a standard issue for Beyonders, especially those in support roles.

  

The lesson transitions into mysticism basics, focusing on symbolism—abstract characters or pictorial representations of items and meanings. Old Neil illustrates various symbols such as constellations, celestial bodies, and planets. Klein's understanding impresses Neil, who then teaches him about divination tools like the astrolabe and crystal ball, along with the selection of incantations.

  

Neil emphasizes the importance of regular practice to internalize this knowledge and harness the power of potions like the Seer potion, which has slightly enhanced Klein's memory. Klein reveals his intention to join the Divination Club on Howes Street in North Borough post-financial stability, aiming to become a proficient Seer. Neil supports this idea, noting that as a Nighthawks staff member and standard Beyonder, Klein's membership would facilitate monitoring potential evil elements within such organizations.

  

Klein expresses his plan to report these expenses to Captain rather than using personal funds, surprising Old Neil with the initiative. The chapter concludes with Neil questioning why Klein didn't discard the tainted coffee, a minor detail highlighting their growing rapport and Klein's adaptation to this new world's customs.
