#### Chapter 20: The Forgetful [[Dunn Smith|Dunn]]

  

[[Klein Moretti|Klein]], now in his new identity as a [[Nighthawks|Nighthawk]], receives further instructions from Captain Dunn Smith regarding his role and responsibilities. Dunn reminds Klein to visit the accountant, [[Mrs. Orianna]], for an advance payment of four weeks' salary—twelve pounds in total. He also advises Klein to upgrade his wardrobe due to the need for a more gentlemanly appearance. Dunn emphasizes that Klein should purchase a cane and a new suit, revealing the high costs associated with such items.

  

As they part ways, Dunn forgets something else and recalls it: Klein must collect ten demon hunting bullets as his [[Welch McGovern]]'s revolver is still in his possession. Dunn explains that these bullets will provide protection against paranormal dangers. Later, Dunn realizes he forgot to mention that Klein should also acquire thirty normal bullets daily for practice at the underground shooting range at No. 3 Zouteland Street. To access this range, Klein needs a badge from [[Old Neil]] and must learn how to handle his firearm effectively.

  

During their conversation, Dunn signs a formal document authorizing Klein's advance payment and demon hunting bullet collection. [[Rozanne]], Dunn's assistant, comments on her captain's forgetfulness as they wait for the note to be completed.

  

Klein visits Mrs. Orianna at Blackthorn Security Company to receive his advance salary. She informs him that she also had a paranormal encounter sixteen years ago involving a serial killer known as the Bloody Butcher, which left her with lingering fear. Klein learns that this serial killer was, in fact, a [[Beyonder]] who performed organ-removing rituals for demonic purposes.

  

Klein then heads to Old Neil's place to discuss the documents and books he should review for his Nighthawk training. Neil, an elderly man with white hair and deep wrinkles, reveals that he possesses a lost [[Roselle’s Diary|Diary of Emperor Roselle Gustav]]—a revered hidden god in some cults. The diary contains strange symbols that Neil has partially deciphered as numbers. He believes that by comparing historical records to the diary entries, he can uncover more about these symbols and their meanings.

  

To Klein's surprise, Neil shares that the symbols are written in Simplified Chinese, a language he recognizes from his past life. This discovery leaves Klein both intrigued and excited about the potential revelations hidden within the diary.

#### Chapter 21: An Old Friend In A Different World

  

Klein, still in disbelief over his [[Transmigration]], discovers a diary written by Emperor Roselle, revealing that the emperor is from the same world. The diary entries are filled with Simplified Chinese, which doesn't exist in this world, indicating the diary was written by someone from Klein's time.

  

Klein reads through three pages of the diary, uncovering insights about [[Beyonder Potions|potions]] and Beyonder abilities:

1. On November 18th, Emperor Roselle discovered a trapped individual who can only approach reality during full moons but cannot transmit cries for help.

2. He expresses a melancholic reflection on time passing, noting how his Chinese writing style resembles a translation due to the passage of four decades.

3. On January 1st, he describes Lady Florena's grandeur at the New Year Gala.

4. On January 2nd, he criticizes incompetent diplomats and ponders past choices.

5. On January 3rd, he discusses the importance of understanding the essence of [[Potion Digestion]] rather than forcefully grasping them, and the symbolic yet concrete imagery embedded within their names as keys to digestion.

6. On September 9th, Emperor Roselle mentions an alliance opposing him from [[Feysac]] in the north, [[Loen Kingdom|Loen]] in the east, and [[Feynapotter]] in the south.

7. On September 23rd, he laments losing contact with a ship seeking the [[Forsaken Land of the Gods]] and considers inventing wireless telegraphs to overcome storm interference.

8. On September 24th, he finds Miss Ithaca more enchanting than Lady Florena, possibly due to nostalgia for his youth.

  

These revelations spark curiosity in Klein, who sees the diary as a potential guide for his own Beyonder journey. He asks Old Neil about obtaining more of Emperor Roselle's diary entries, learning that such records are rare due to the decline of extraordinary species in the Northern Continent, which has led to fewer Beyonders and mysteries.

  

In a light-hearted moment, Klein suggests establishing a "Dragons and Giants Protection Association," which evolves into a broader "Fantastic Organisms Protection Association" with Old Neil's humorous endorsement.

  

Old Neil retrieves items for Klein—demon hunting bullets, revolver bullets, an ox-hide underarm holster, and a Seventh Unit, Special Operations Department badge. Klein tries on the holster and prepares to leave when he encounters [[Leonard Mitchell]], a Nighthawk known for his poetic nature and [[Sequence 8 - Midnight Poet]] abilities.

  

Leonard acknowledges Klein's unique disposition, hinting at some special traits that Klein remains unaware of. Their brief conversation ends with Leonard mentioning something about noticing details others might miss, suggesting a keen observational ability.

#### Chapter 22: Starting Sequence

  

Klein, having just been granted permission by Captain to visit [[Tingen University]], is about to bid Rozanne farewell when he inquires about the Church's complete [[Sequences|Beyonder Sequence]]. Rozanne, surprised, reveals that becoming a Beyonder involves immense danger and potential self-sacrifice. She shares her father's cautionary tale of [[losing control]] due to extraordinary powers. Despite this, Klein expresses curiosity about the basics of Beyonder abilities.

  

Rozanne explains that in their Church, high Sequencers are rare, with only thirty or so Beyonders in Tingen City and its suburbs, home to hundreds of thousands of people. The starting Sequence for a complete Beyonder is [[Sequence 9 - Sleepless]], allowing individuals not to sleep at night and enhancing physical strength, intuition, and mental capabilities as the night deepens. Rozanne also mentions Sequence 8's Midnight Poet and [[Sequence 7 - Nightmare]], with Captain possibly being one of the two Sequence 7 Beyonders in Tingen City.

  

Klein learns that a Sequence 9 Beyonder can study and grasp more knowledge to understand his [[transmigration]] and lay foundations for future ones. Rozanne mentions the Mystery Pryer, a potion formula associated with Sequence 9, and reveals an incomplete Sequence 7 title called Spirit Medium, which Ma'am [[Daly Simone|Daly]] possesses. Klein confesses to having met Ma'am Daly, leading Rozanne to express envy over his connection to such an impressive Beyonder.

  

After their conversation, Klein, feeling satisfied with the information gathered, takes out twelve gold pound notes—a gesture of gratitude according to the Foodaholic Empire's customs—and heads downstairs, smiling at the thought of treating [[Melissa Moretti|Melissa]] to dinner.

#### Chapter 23: Side Arm

  

Klein, while strolling through Zouteland, faces a dilemma - he has insufficient funds for a public carriage to reach Iron Cross Street. Contemplating various solutions, including walking or purchasing items to obtain change, he dismisses each due to safety concerns and extravagant costs.

  

Spotting a clothing shop named Wilker Clothing and Hats, Klein devises a plan: buying an appropriately priced item to acquire the necessary change. Inside, he approaches a salesperson dressed in a white shirt and red vest, expressing interest in purchasing a cane for its utility as both a fashion accessory and a potential self-defense tool.

  

The salesperson presents Klein with an Ironheart wood cane priced at eleven soli seven pence, which Klein finds exorbitant. Undeterred, he tries several other canes until settling on one made from ebony wood and inlaid with silver for seven soli six pence. After purchasing it, Klein tests the cane's weight and balance, finding it suitable for his needs.

  

Upon exiting the store, Klein discovers that carrying the cane has caused nearby salespeople to view him warily, fearing he might use it as a weapon. Recognizing their wariness, Klein humorously assures them of his peaceful intentions, and they return to their duties.

  

Following the purchase, Klein heads to a short-distance trackless carriage, spending six pence for the ride home. Once there, he retrieves his bronze revolver from its hiding place, inserts five silver demon hunting bullets with Dark Sacred Emblems, and secures it in an armpit holster.

  

Later, Klein surprises Melissa by suggesting they dine at Silver Crown Restaurant on Daffodil Street to celebrate his new job - a position as a professional consultant for a security company specializing in ancient relic protection. The job pays three pounds per week over a five-year contract and includes an advance of four weeks' pay. Klein shares that the additional income is intended for securing a larger living space with multiple rooms and a bathroom, a luxury they currently lack. Melissa, initially surprised, eventually supports his decision despite her initial reservations about moving from their current comfortable residence.


---
  
#### Chapter 24: Penny-Pincher

  

Klein finds himself in a conversation with Melissa about moving out of their current living quarters. He argues that as he's earning three pounds a week, it would be appropriate to live accordingly, citing future magical rituals and the inconvenience of bunk beds for a guest. Despite his arguments, Melissa insists on saving more money before making such a move. Klein concedes and suggests waiting until [[Benson Moretti|Benson]] returns from his absence.

  

During their discussion, Klein recalls past experiences of shared living conditions, emphasizing the potential issues with many people in one apartment building for future magical practices. He humorously mimics Benson's reaction to finding an empty home upon return, which amuses Melissa.

  

The conversation shifts towards financial prudence when Klein suggests they celebrate by buying simple meals from hawkers on Iron Cross Street—pan-fried fish, black-pepper beef, butter, and malt beer. Melissa advises saving money for emergencies, citing a classmate whose father's company went bankrupt, leading to poor living conditions after losing temporary work at the pier. Klein acknowledges her point but assures her that his job is stable and provides steady income.

  

Klein then plans to buy additional items for Melissa: fruits from hawkers who sell low-quality produce at cheap prices, and a lemon cake as a treat from Mrs. Smyrin. He gives her the money and reminds her to enjoy the small luxury.

  

The chapter transitions to Klein visiting Tingen University for an interview he no longer needs due to securing employment elsewhere. On his way, he reflects on the university's grandeur compared to Khoy University across the river. Upon arrival, he registers and finds his way to the office of Mr. Stone, who had previously read his recommendation letter.

  

Klein informs Mr. Stone about his new job as a consultant for a security company focused on ancient relic protection, earning him three pounds weekly. Mr. Stone praises Klein's courtesy and plans to notify the professors of his decision. During this meeting, Senior Associate Professor Quentin Cohen and lecturer [[Mr. Azik]] enter, having come for an academic conference.

  

Cohen congratulates Klein on his new job, appreciating his consideration in informing them despite not needing the interview. Azik asks about [[Welch McGovern|Welch]] and [[Naya]], who were reportedly killed by burglars. Klein explains that Welch had acquired a diary from the [[Solomon Empire]]'s [[Antigonus Family]] during the [[Fourth Epoch]], seeking help in interpreting it. Klein had assisted for a while but became busy with job hunting; police even questioned him regarding the matter.

  

Hearing "Fourth Epoch" and "Antigonus," Azik seems momentarily puzzled but unable to recall specifics, leaving Cohen frowning in contemplation.

#### Chapter 25: Cathedral

  

Klein, feeling a persistent and intense gaze, suspects he is being watched as he reads the Tingen Morning Post in a university office. After parting ways with Professors Azik and Cohen, Klein heads out, clutching the newspaper. He experiences the sensation of being observed as he walks through the boulevard, recalling similar feelings from his past life.

  

Knowing that someone might be following him, Klein decides to board a public carriage instead of walking directly home or seeking assistance from the Nighthawks on Zouteland Street. He pays for his fare with coins and, upon exiting the carriage at Champagne Street, continues to feel watched. To avoid leading potential pursuers to his residence, Klein takes an indirect route towards Red Moonlight Street.

  

Arriving at [[Saint Selena Cathedral]]—the Tingen headquarters of the [[Church of the Evernight Goddess]] —Klein enters the cathedral, seeking solace and protection from the feeling of being stalked. The cathedral's Gothic design, complete with a tall clock tower and blue-and-red checkered windows, exudes an air of mystery and darkness. Klein finds comfort in the dimly lit interior, away from the constant sensation of surveillance.

  

Sitting quietly during Mass, Klein listens intently as the bishop preaches about the [[Evernight Goddess]]'s love for the downtrodden. Feeling a sense of calm and spiritual cleansing, he remains focused on the sermon until it concludes. Afterward, Klein takes his turn in confession, revealing to the bishop that someone is following him and requesting assistance in locating Dunn Smith, an agent from the Seventh Unit's Special Operations Department.

  

The bishop directs Klein to a secret door leading to a private chamber. After following the instructions provided by a priest, Klein finds himself in a secure location away from prying eyes, where he can gather his thoughts and plan his next steps without fear of being observed.

  

Throughout this chapter, the world of [[Loen Kingdom]] is further explored through references to its newspapers, public transportation, and religious institutions like the Church of Evernight. The Beyonder system's mystical aspects are hinted at through Klein's heightened sense of being watched, which may be linked to his transmigration or an enhanced ability from a ritual. Additionally, the cathedral serves as a significant location with its architectural style and religious significance.

#### Chapter 26: Practice

  

Klein, now assuming the identity of Klein Moretti, follows a priest through a secret passageway from Saint Selena Cathedral after receiving a warning about being followed. Upon reaching Blackthorn Security Company, he informs Captain Dunn Smith that someone is following him, likely due to his possession of the Antigonus family's notebook. Dunn suggests it might be a private investigator from Wind City, a city known for its advanced industries. Klein is instructed to return to the cathedral and act normally to assess whether this is indeed the case.

  

After exiting the cathedral, Klein feels the weight of being observed lifts, suspecting his pursuer may have reservations about entering holy ground or fearing detection by Beyonders—individuals with mystical abilities. He decides to visit the Zouteland Shooting Club, part of an underground police range, to practice shooting. Here, he uses a revolver and brass bullets, focusing on improving his accuracy and control over the weapon's recoil.

  

Klein's practice sessions are meticulous and determined. He starts with basic aiming and holding stances, gradually transitioning to firing drills. Despite initial misses, he persistently refines his technique until hitting the target consistently. Upon completing his session, Klein feels more confident and less anxious about potential pursuit.

  

Returning home, Klein encounters his brother Benson at their apartment on Iron Cross Street. Benson, a man in his mid-twenties with a penchant for nationalistic views, initially startles Klein but quickly lightens up upon hearing about Klein's new job offer, which pays three pounds weekly—considerably better than expected. The conversation touches on the complexities of their coin system, leading Benson to express strong opinions about its flaws, revealing his nationalistic tendencies.

  

This chapter introduces the Zouteland Shooting Club as an underground police facility and expands on Klein's meticulous approach to firearm practice. It also highlights the complexities of Loen Kingdom's coin system and Benson Moretti's nationalistic views, providing insight into Klein's family dynamics.

#### Chapter 27: Siblings' Dinner

  

In this chapter, Klein Moretti shares a meal with his siblings Benson and Melissa in their home. The narrative provides insights into the siblings' living conditions and daily life.

  

Klein, using his knowledge from a previous incarnation, engages in light-hearted banter with Benson, who praises Klein's improved sense of humor. Benson reveals plans to visit the pier in the afternoon and later discuss rental options for terrace houses at Tingen City Housing Improvement Company, while also planning a visit to their landlord, Mr. Franky.

  

Klein, however, recalls a crucial detail he had forgotten: their one-year lease agreement with Mr. Franky, which has only been six months. This realization prompts a discussion between the brothers about the complexities of tenant-landlord relationships and the financial implications of breaking a contract. Benson assures Klein that Mr. Franky is not particularly astute, suggesting they could negotiate their way out of potential penalties.

  

The chapter then transitions to the preparation of their dinner. Using leftover pan-fried fish, Klein whips up a soup with vegetables, supplemented by purchases from Lettuce and Meat market - including beef, fish, potatoes, peas, radishes, rhubarb, lettuce, turnips, rosemary, basil, cumin, cooking oil, and butter. Despite feeling watched, Klein proceeds with his culinary endeavor.

  

The dinner scene unfolds with the siblings appreciating Klein's cooking. The meal includes stewed beef, tender potatoes, thick pea soup, stewed rhubarb, buttered rye bread, and ginger beer - a non-alcoholic beverage that mimics the taste of beer. Klein's dishes, though not up to his usual standards due to lack of certain ingredients, are generally well-received by Benson and Melissa.

  

The chapter concludes with the siblings engaging in a light-hearted conversation post-meal, followed by evening routines - studying for Benson and Klein, and relaxation for Melissa. As they prepare for bed around 11 PM, Klein experiences a dream-like encounter where he sees Dunn Smith, warning him about an intruder in his room. Awakening from the dream, Klein discovers an unfamiliar individual at his desk, rummaging silently.

#### Chapter 28: Secret Order

  

Klein, now aware he is Klein Moretti in the world of Loen Kingdom, finds himself in a tense situation. In his room shared with Benson and Melissa, an unknown intruder has entered, prompting Klein to arm himself with a revolver. Despite his lack of confidence in shooting a moving target, he recalls a principle from his past life: the greatest strength lies before launching a nuclear weapon—or, in this case, before pulling the trigger.

  

Klein opts for intimidation over immediate attack, employing a strategy inspired by an idiom from the Foodaholic Empire: "Where there is precaution, there will be no danger." He manages to get the intruder to turn around and move slowly towards the door, all while maintaining his composure. As the intruder exits, Klein hears a soft, calming melody, which lulls Benson and Melissa back into sleep.

  

Dunn Smith, identified as a member of the Nighthawks, enters shortly afterward, confirming that the intruder was a member of the ancient Secret Order. Established in the Fourth Epoch and linked to the Solomon Empire and fallen aristocrats, this organization sought the Antigonus family diary, which had been acquired by Welch Vintner. Dunn explains that they plan to capture remaining members of the Secret Order based on clues gathered, though he acknowledges their expertise in hiding.

  

Dunn then offers Klein a choice: become a Beyonder by selecting an incomplete Sequence 9 or accumulate merit to eventually become a Sleepless, the first complete Sequence granted by the Goddess to Nighthawks. Among the Sequence 9 options presented are three potion formulas obtained from the [[Moses Ascetic Order]]: [[Sequence 9 - Mystery Pryer]], [[Sequence 9 - Corpse Collector]], and [[Sequence 9 - Seer]].

  

Mystery Pryer grants a comprehensive but rudimentary understanding of mystical knowledge and magical rituals while allowing Beyonders to sense certain hidden entities. Klein expresses interest in this Sequence, as it aligns with his desire for knowledge.

  

Corpse Collector is popular among death-worshipping cultists in the [[Southern Continent]]; consuming the potion grants resistance to cold and decay, allowing direct observation of evil spirits and undead creatures while providing attribute enhancements. The Nighthawks possess Sequence 8 (Corpse Collector) and [[Sequence 7 - Spirit Medium]], with Klein noting that Daly chose the latter in the past.

  

Lastly, Seer is a mysterious Sequence about which little is known, except it might be held by the Holy Cathedral. This option intrigues Klein, who recalls Emperor Roselle's regret for not choosing [[Sequence 9 - Apprentice]], [[Sequence 9 - Marauder]], or Seer in his diary. Ultimately, Klein remains undecided but considers each option carefully before making his choice.


---

#### Chapter 29: "Jobs" and Rentals Are Serious Business

  

Klein, still grappling with the decision between becoming a Mystery Pryer or a Seer, asks Dunn Smith about the abilities granted by consuming the Seer potion. Dunn clarifies that Seers gain access to various mystical disciplines like astromancy, cartomancy, spiritual pendulums, and scrying but emphasizes that these abilities require extensive learning and ritual preparation for practical application. He also points out the lack of direct combat capabilities for Seers compared to Mystery Pryers or Corpse Collectors, a fact that troubles Klein.

  

Despite his initial enthusiasm for becoming a Beyonder, Klein finds himself in a quandary due to potential risks such as loss of control and the lack of subsequent Sequences available through the Church of Evernight or the Holy Cathedral. The illusory dangers posed by Emperor Roselle's diaries and the corruptive whispers further complicate his decision-making process.

  

After Dunn Smith leaves, Klein reflects on his life before becoming a Beyonder, remembering his family, friends, and past activities in Tingen City. He ultimately decides to take some time to think over his options.

  

Meanwhile, Klein and his siblings, Benson and Melissa, discuss their living situation. They discover an advertisement for a spacious rental property at 3 Wendel Street in North Borough, complete with multiple bedrooms, bathrooms, balconies, and private land. They plan to visit the Tingen City Housing Improvement Company on Daffodil Street to explore affordable housing options for their growing family.

  

Benson explains that such housing associations or companies emerged post-[[Backlund]], funded through charitable donations, government grants at a 4% special rate, and investor returns of 5%. Klein and Melissa learn about the stringent application criteria for more upscale charity-run apartments, like those provided by Sir Deweyville's Deweyville Trust. Benson highlights potential drawbacks, such as strict vaccine requirements, communal bathrooms, and restrictions on subleasing or commercial activities within these units.

  

The trio visits the Tingen City Housing Improvement Company, where they meet Scarter, a middle-aged man who offers them five available terrace houses ranging from 12 to 16 solis per week. They decide to first inspect the property at 2 Daffodil Street, familiar ground for Klein and his siblings.


---
  
#### Chapter 30: Brand New Beginning

  

Klein Moretti, Benson, and Melissa find themselves touring a new rental property managed by the Tingen City Housing Improvement Company. The property at 2, 4, and 6 Daffodil Street is a terrace house with multifaceted hipped roofs, painted grayish-blue, and featuring three chimneys. The house layout includes an open concept living room that doubles as a guest hall, a dining area with a rectangular red wooden table, and a fireplace for winter warmth. Two bedrooms are on each side of the house, with an additional small guest room and bathroom on the first floor. The second floor contains two more bedrooms and a balcony, though it's noted to be quite tiny.

  

Scarter, the representative from the Housing Improvement Company, explains that rent includes weekly furniture usage for five pence and a deposit of four weeks' rent. Klein, intrigued by the possibility of property ownership in this world, asks about buying the house. Scarter informs him that such properties are only available for rent, with no option to purchase.

  

The siblings discuss the living space, finding it spacious yet lacking in certain amenities like proper lighting and a larger balcony. Benson, more critical than his siblings, negotiates lower rent, furniture usage fees, and the deposit down to twelve soli, three pence, and two pounds respectively. Impressed by Benson's persuasive skills, Klein and Melissa nod in agreement.

  

After finalizing the contract at the Housing Improvement Company, they proceed to the Notary Office of Tingen City to notarize it. With the deposit and first week’s rent paid, they are left with nine pounds, two soli, and eight pence. Klein, practical as always, suggests changing the locks immediately due to potential security concerns.

  

The siblings then visit their previous landlord, Mr. Franky, at Iron Cross Street to terminate their lease early. Benson uses his charm and strategic reasoning to negotiate a compensation deal for early termination, convincing Franky that he could secure higher rent from a larger family. After agreeing on terms, the siblings sign the termination contract, leaving them free to move into their new Daffodil Street residence.

  

The chapter concludes with the trio's move-in process, highlighting their relief and excitement after settling into their new home. Klein, dressed in formal attire for the first time, stands before a mirror, appreciating his transformed appearance as he prepares to start anew at Blackthorn Security Company.
