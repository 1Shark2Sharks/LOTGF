#### Chapter 11: Real Culinary Skills

The policemen left as quickly as they came, and Klein gave them an acting performance as if he were reacting as a commoner. The rest of the chapter is Klein cooking food for Melissa, which according to her reaction, was a rarity and unexpected.

#### Chapter 12: Here Again

In the middle of the night, an inspecter called [[Dunn Smith]] knocked on Klein’s door, and noted that Klein was the primary suspect behind Mr. Welch and Naya’s suicides. Mr. Welch had been missing a revolver, which turned out to be the one Klein had. Klein told Dunn almost everything that happened, leaving out crucial information such as the fact that he actually shot himself with a bullet instead of him missing and the world above the gray fog. Dunn took Klein to the police station, where an expert was waiting for him. On the way into the carriage, a commotion happened in the street, which allowed Klein to disappear into the crowd in an attempt to get a boat to Backlund. He hopped on another carriage to the pier, but it turns out, the driver was Dunn Smith! Klein then woke up from his nightmare to a [[Crimson Moon]], where he looked out of the window and saw Dunn Smith again.

#### Chapter 13: Nighthawk

Dunn reintroduced himself as a Nighthawk, a codename of the [[Church of the Evernight Goddess]]’s beyonders. Dunn said that instead of directly controlling dreams, he just guides them. However, Klein was completely rational and sober in his dreams, knowing what to say and what not to say. Therefore, Klein concluded that he showed Dunn what he wanted to see, and being able to resist abilities like this probably came from his transmigration. Dunn still insisted on taking him to see the expert, as he is the only lead to the [[The Diary of the Antigonous Family|Antigonus Notebook]]. During the carriage ride, Dunn warned him of the lingering effects that come with contact with the supernatural. A man had ended up strangling himself years later after he had participated in a ritual. They arrive at Welch’s apartment, and the expert is revealed to be a spirit medium.

#### Chapter 14: The Medium

Walking towards Welch’s residence, Klein felt that someone was watching him, which turned out to be spirits. They enter the house and meet [[Daly Simone]], the spirit medium. After some friendly banter, Daly provides Klein with a candle that forces him to relax, though he still was able to form rational thoughts. He ends up lying to Daly about having any relation to the situation. Dunn then invites Klein to be a civilian staff, or become a Beyonder in order to prevent any mishaps that come with contacting the supernatural. Dunn then warns Klein about the dangers of being a beyonder, such as [[Losing Control]].

#### Chapter 15: The Invitation

Dunn says that civilian staff would be privy to relevant secrets and access the world of Beyonders and still have the choice to become a Beyonder, though the Churches are very strict on who is eligible to become one. The world of the Beyonders is under strict confidentiality due to the stupidity of humanity, as if more people knew about the supernatural, it would create more chaos. Klein decides to think about the offer to become a civilian staff, and he is dropped off by Dunn.

#### Chapter 16: Rat-baiting With Dogs

Klein returns home and runs into Melissa, who was also having trouble sleeping. After a brief conversation, they both go to bed. After weighing the pros and cons of joining the Nighthawks, he eventually decided to do it the next day. He decided to board a carriage to the pub, where he was redirected to the Blackthorn Security Company after using a code phrase.

#### Chapter 17: Special Operations Department

Entering the building, Klein was met with a fairly shabby reception room, with a girl reading a newspaper, oblivious to Klein. After making his presence and intentions known, the girl went to get Dunn, or “The Captain” who was guarding the “[[Chanis Gate]],” and was unable to leave his post. The girl’s name is [[Rozanne]], who is a civilian staff, and not a Beyonder. She takes him underground, which has many hallways leading to different parts of the city. Eventually, he gets dropped off at the Chanis Gate. Dunn already had a contract prepared, which Klein signed. The purpose of the security company is then revealed. They have 4 normal units, such as the police, while the divisions from unit five onwards deal with the supernatural incidents related to the followers of the [[Evernight Goddess]], but not the other churches. Note that not all of the units are from the Church of the Evernight Goddess, but the units are split up between the churches. For example, unit Six is the [[Mandated Punishers]] squad from the Church of the Lord of the Storms. There are 6 beyonders and 6 civilian staff in the Nighthawks.

#### Chapter 18: Origin and Cause

Starting off the chapter, we learn about the myth of creation for this world. [[The Creator]] awoke from Chaos and fused himself with the universe, creating everything within it. The myth is very detailed, with every prominent race corresponding to a part of the Creator. This process started the [[First Epoch]], the Chaos Epoch. The [[Third Epoch]] was known as the Cataclysm Epoch, when Mother Earth and the God of War appeared, and humanity went through a major crisis. Humans were made from the Creator’s wisdom, which is why they lack strength. Instead, they took the powers of mythical creatures and put them in Beyonder potions, allowing them to harness “magic.” If high grade potions were consumed, there are 3 possible tragic outcomes. First, each part of their body would become a monster. Second, their personality will change to become more indifferent, cruel, etc. Third is “losing control,” where people become crazy and devilish. There are 5 ways to lose control. The first was just stated. If a person who innately has partial [[Beyonder Characteristics]], they are chained to a specific [[Pathway]]. If they consume another path’s potion, they will lose control. The third kind is if you go choose a Sequence and drink [[Beyonder Potions]] from another path, you will lose control. Fourth is if you consume a higher ranked potion without completely understanding the potion currently consumed, you will lose control. Finally, if they get enticed or bewitched, leading to greedy desires, they will start to lose control. And the Sequences prevent most of this from happening by providing a stable progression path. Each of the seven churches control one complete Sequence.

#### Chapter 19: Sealed Artifacts

Klein is told the basic work duties of a civilian staff, but he is actually assigned to try to regain his lost memories. [[The Diary of the Antigonous Family]] has disappeared, and they suspect that Klein must have hidden it somewhere (before he lost his memories). The Chanis Gate, named after the creator of the Nighthawk system, Archbishop Chanis, is introduced and explained. There are two “keepers” inside and countless traps. It holds precious thing such as potion formulas, magical materials, and can even act as a prison. [[Sealed Artifacts]] are also introduced. They are items that are important or magical. Some hold “living” characteristics, which is not elaborated on. They are sorted by grades, from 0 to 3, based on their danger. They have magical properties, so they can be utilized if careful, but come with danger. [[Ince Zangwill]] is also introduced in this chapter, a former Gatekeeper who was enticed by the devil and escaped with Sealed Artifact [[0-08]].

#### Chapter 20: The Forgetful Dunn

Klein is given 12 pounds as advance payment, and told to meet the other members of the Nighthawks, [[Old Neil]] and [[Orianna]]. He is also told to train himself to shoot using Welch’s revolver. After getting the money from Mrs. Orianna, he goes to meet Old Neil, an old man with red pupils. He is also a sort of historian, like Klein. He has been investigating Roselle Gustav’s lost diary, which was written in “mysterious symbols,” which turned out to be Simplified Chinese.
