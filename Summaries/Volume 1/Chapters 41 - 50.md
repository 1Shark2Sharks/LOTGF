#### Chapter 41: [[Audrey Hall|Audrey]] and Her [[Susie]]

In the [[Blackthorn Security Company]], [[Klein Moretti|Klein]], having finished his morning routine of Cogitating, studying mysticism, and reading historical documents, prepares an expenditure application for Captain [[Dunn Smith]]. The office is quiet, with only [[Rozanne]] at the reception desk. After completing his document, Klein knocks on Dunn's door to submit it.

Meanwhile, in a private chemistry laboratory, [[Audrey Hall|Audrey]], a talented mysticism practitioner, successfully concocts a [[Sequence 9 - Spectator|Spectator]] [[Beyonder Potions|potion]] after several attempts. She prepares to drink the silver substance when her golden retriever, [[Susie]], barks outside. Annie, her maidservant, informs her of an invitation from Duchess Della for afternoon tea and a literature salon. Audrey, feigning a headache, declines the invitation, citing the need for rest.

As she returns to her laboratory, Audrey discovers Susie has let herself in, and the potion cup is shattered on the floor, with Susie licking up the remnants. Frustrated but determined, Audrey quickly prepares a second batch of the Spectator potion.

Simultaneously, in the seas beyond [[Pritz Harbor]], Alger Wilson, captain of the [[Blue Avenger]], explains to Sainz his choice to sail and monitor the Storm-controlled kingdom rather than pursue prestigious roles within the kingdom. Back on land, Klein enjoys 'office rations' with Rozanne and [[Bredt]] in the reception hall of Blackthorn Security Company when a drenched man arrives with a mission request for the former small mercenary squad.

#### Chapter 42: Butler Klee

Klein is spending his afternoon at the office when a visitor arrives. The lanky man, Klee, introduces himself as butler to Vickroy, a tobacco merchant whose son, Elliott, was kidnapped that morning. Despite the police involvement, Mr. Vickroy is uneasy and wishes to engage Blackthorn Security for additional investigation, offering 100 pounds for locating the hideout and 200 pounds for rescuing his son safely.

Rozanne, the receptionist, quickly drafts a simple contract after Klee's request, and he signs it alongside [[Leonard Mitchell]]. Leonard suggests that they work together on the mission.

The security company's current state is far from professional, with no standard templates for contracts, and Klein contemplates the inadequacy of their operations compared to the [[Nighthawks|Nighthawk]] team's reputation. Despite this, they accept the mission, signaling a potential opportunity for Klein to utilize his [[Beyonder]] abilities in a real-world case.


---

#### Chapter 43: Search

Klein, Leonard, and Klee embark on a mission to locate Elliott Vickroy, who was kidnapped. They collect items belonging to the young boy - his recent clothes and a Storm Amulet he wore - to aid in [[Divination|divination]]. Klee, a unique pet owner with an exceptional sense of smell, assists by providing these personal effects.

The trio travels in a private carriage, bypassing Elliott's residence to avoid alerting the kidnappers. As they journey, Leonard hints that Klein's mysterious notebook will reappear soon. Klein uses a technique called "Dowsing Rod Seeking" to locate Elliott. He employs his black cane entwined with the Storm Amulet as a divining tool.

After thirty minutes of searching, Klein determines that Elliott is inside a three-story building. Using his cane again, he pinpoints the exact room where Elliott and his kidnappers are held. The cane points to a specific room on the third floor, revealing the presence of three kidnappers and one hostage, consistent with Klee's earlier information about their weapons.

Before entering, Leonard recites a poem mocking the kidnappers' actions. He expresses a desire for them to be "civilized persons" rather than criminals. The group then proceeds to confront the kidnappers, armed with knowledge of their location and numbers.

#### Chapter 44: Fate

Leonard's lullaby-like singing lulls Klein into a trance-like state, where he experiences vivid, dream-like sensations. Suddenly regaining consciousness, Klein prepares for action as Leonard breaks open the door to the kidnappers' hideout with precise control. Leonard swiftly dispatches one unsuspecting kidnapper while Klein readies his revolver, aiming at potential threats.

As they enter the room, they find Elliott Vickroy, the hostage, and three subdued kidnappers tied up by Leonard using their own ropes. The black-haired, green-eyed Nighthawk casually explains their identities as mercenaries hired by Elliott's father for security purposes. Relieved, Elliott expresses gratitude for his rescue.

Leonard instructs Klein to seek assistance from nearby patrolling officers, informing them of the situation without revealing their involvement as Beyonders—individuals with extraordinary abilities. Klein complies, using a permit for an all-purpose weapon obtained through internal channels, avoiding suspicion.

Upon resolving the hostage crisis swiftly, Leonard and Klein depart before law enforcement arrives. Elliott's parents and butler, Klee, soon arrive at the scene, astonished by the rapid resolution. Leonard explains their gesture as a peaceful aristocratic custom following conflict.

Discussing payment, Leonard reveals that half of their 200-pound commission will go to [[Orianna]] for team funding, leaving Klein with only about ten percent due to his non-formal status. Despite initial reservations, Klein accepts the terms, acknowledging the Beyonders' ability to create plausible explanations for their actions—in this case, attributing the kidnappers' sudden slumber to favorable weather conditions and soothing music.

Returning home, Klein experiences a haunting déjà vu as he encounters a black notebook with [[The Fool]] card image inside, bearing the ominous message "Everyone will die, including me." Realizing it's the same [[The Diary of the Antigonous Family|Antigonus family's notebook]] from his dreams, Klein frantically searches his memory for overlooked details during their operation, now suspecting a deeper connection to the mysterious Beyonder abilities.

#### Chapter 45: Returning

Klein Moretti, a member of the Nighthawks, an organization dedicated to investigating supernatural crimes in the city of [[Loen Kingdom|Loen]], awakens with a sense of urgency. Despite his usual routine, he finds himself in a state of readiness, convinced that his intuition is guiding him towards something significant. He quickly changes into formal attire, equipping himself with a revolver concealed under his pillow, and leaves a note for his siblings, informing them of an early work commitment.

Stepping out onto the quiet street at six in the morning, Klein encounters a rare public carriage operating during this unusual hour. After paying the fare, he settles into the empty vehicle, engaging the driver in casual conversation to distract himself from his mounting tension. The carriage, operated by a hardworking crew earning meager wages, picks up additional passengers en route to Zouteland Street.

Upon arrival, Klein swiftly enters the Blackthorn Security Company building and locates Captain Dunn Smith in his office. Informing him of a revelation from a dream, Klein reveals that the Antigonus family's notebook—a mysterious artifact of immense power—is hidden in the apartment across from the kidnappers' location. Despite initial skepticism, Dunn dispatches Leonard Mitchell, [[Old Neil]], and [[Sequence 9 - Corpse Collector|Corpse Collector]] [[Frye]] to retrieve the notebook.

The team travels by carriage to the specified building, navigating the early-morning streets with caution. Upon arrival, Klein's spiritual perception confirms that the apartment is unoccupied and devoid of magical energy, aligning with Corpse Collector Frye's assertion of no evil spirits present. Leonard forcefully opens the door, revealing a putrid stench emanating from within.

Inside, they discover an old woman clothed in black and white, her body swollen and covered in maggots. As she collapses, Klein's sensitive nose triggers his gag reflex, forcing him to retch due to the overwhelming stench of decay. The scene suggests a gruesome end for the kidnappers, their bodies left undisturbed for an extended period, possibly serving as a macabre deterrent or warning to those who might dare cross the Nighthawks.

#### Chapter 46: Portrait

Klein, suffering from nausea, vomits in a mysterious room. A tin-colored flask, reminiscent of a cigar box, materializes before him. The flask's pungent smell—a blend of tobacco, disinfectant, and mint leaves—alleviates Klein's sickness. Corpse Collector Frye, known for his cold demeanor, appears with the flask, offering it without a word. After using it, Klein stands up, feeling rejuvenated.

Detective Dunn Smith asks if the room seems familiar to Klein. In his [[Spirit Vision]] state, Klein recalls vivid memories of this place—a chimney, rocking chair, table, newspapers, and a rusty door with silver nails. The scene is eerily similar but more blurry and illusory than reality. An indistinct voice echoes, repeating "Hornacis... Flegrea..."

Klein, recognizing the term 'Hornacis' from his original diary deciphered from the [[The Diary of the Antigonous Family|Antigonus family's notebook]], feels a chill of realization—this could be an enticement. Dunn opens a cupboard filled with moldy bread and deceased rats. He instructs Leonard Mitchell to fetch patrolling officers for further investigation.

The coroner, Frye, assesses the victim—Katy Stefania Bieber, a widow who lived with her adult son Ray. The cause of death remains unclear, but it's not magical in origin. Dunn, concerned about potential evidence, directs Leonard to question residents on the first floor for more information.

Old Neil, another member of the team, performs a ritual using thumb-sized bottles and powder to create an invisible forcefield around Klein and the others. He then swiftly sketches Ray Bieber's portrait based on residual energies in the room—black hair, deep blue eyes, and a ceramic tooth implant.

Afterward, Klein attempts divination using a dowsing rod to locate Ray but encounters interference from unknown forces. Dunn suggests questioning residents with the portrait for confirmation before issuing an arrest warrant for Ray's murder of his mother.

Old Neil explains that sending the Antigonus family's notebook to [[Ray Bieber]] was likely to provoke a supernatural entity tied to the book, aiming to erase all traces and prevent discovery. Klein, puzzled by his own survival, questions why he had to deliver the notebook to Ray specifically. Old Neil hypothesizes it could be due to Ray's Life Path Number aligning with requirements or him being a descendant of the Antigonus family, though Dunn must address the implications of this decision as Klein ponders his own survival and the vanished notebook.

A Life Path Number, according to Pythagoras, is derived from one's birthdate, outlining the course of their life journey.

#### Chapter 47: Old Neil's Lack of Money

Klein, now aware that his past life's notebook is in Ray Bieber's possession and the situation exposed, meets with Old Neil at Blackthorn Security Company. Old Neil reassures Klein that the secretive power causing their predicament won't pay them special attention as long as they don't provoke it. He also mentions that a warrant for Ray Bieber will divert the focus of the [[Secret Order]], a millennia-old organization known for its extensive information channels.

Old Neil and Klein share a moment of camaraderie, each tapping their chests in praise to the Lady (presumably the Goddess of their world). Mrs. Orianna, the elegant head of Blackthorn Security Company, enters with news about the successful completion of their recent mission. She informs Klein that he will receive 10% of the 200-pound commission for his part in the hostage rescue, as he's not yet a formal member.

Klein reflects on the unfairness of the situation, where two Beyonders solved the problem effortlessly. Mrs. Orianna attributes their luck to the absence of divine protection for the kidnappers. Old Neil shares that jobs at Blackthorn are scarce, with weeks sometimes passing without any work. He explains that their weekly salary of twelve pounds, exempt from taxes, is considered generous within the company.

Klein, surprised by this revelation, questions Old Neil about his financial situation. Old Neil admits to earning only twelve pounds a week from both the Church and police department, emphasizing that it's insufficient for Beyonders who frequently study hidden mysteries and practice rituals. Materials for these studies can't always be obtained through legitimate channels and often require personal expenditure or purchases from underground markets.

Old Neil explains the existence of such markets, which sell materials derived from both extraordinary and ordinary beings, as it's impractical for the Churches to control every aspect. He also mentions that these markets can provide access to rare items, though they sometimes deal in contraband. Old Neil reluctantly agrees to take Klein to the underground market when he needs a thirty-pound bill paid, revealing his current financial strain.

Klein, now having earned ten pounds from their recent mission, offers to lend Old Neil money, but Old Neil declines, stating he'll manage on his own. The chapter concludes with Klein planning to visit the [[Divination Club]] to purchase materials for his studies, eager to begin "[[Acting Method|acting]]" following occasional murmurs and illusions from his Cogitation and [[Spirit Vision]] abilities.

#### Chapter 48: [[Hanass Vincent]]

[[Klein Moretti]], now a member of Tingen City's Divination Club, visits the club on his second day as a member. Upon arrival, he encounters Angelica Barrehart, the lady who manages the club. She informs him that Mr. Glacis, the fortune-teller Klein previously consulted, has not visited the club since then. Intrigued by her ability to remember him, Klein decides to join the club himself.

Angelica outlines the membership process, detailing the five-pound initial fee and subsequent annual fees of one pound. After confirming his registration, she hands him a set of dark gold cufflinks with inscriptions signifying his membership. She also asks about Klein's divination expertise, to which he modestly replies that he is familiar with all forms of divination but does not require special considerations.

Angelica informs Klein that he can start telling fortunes within the club once his skills are validated. However, until confirmed, the club won't promote him to customers. Klein sets his initial rate at two pence per session. Angelica clarifies that the club will take a quarterpence as their commission.

Klein then attends an astrolabe divination class conducted by Hanass Vincent, a middle-aged man known for his expertise in this complex form of divination. The class is attended by six other members, and Klein observes their reactions and interactions while listening to the lecture. Using his Spirit Vision ability, Klein discreetly examines Hanass Vincent's aura, noting that it indicates worry, although the rest of his health appears sound.

After the class, Edward Steve, one of the club members, approaches Klein and introduces himself. They engage in a friendly conversation about divination methods and pricing strategies. Edward shares his approach to setting prices as 'middle-of-the-road,' appealing to customers who seek value without being excessively expensive or cheap. This conversation prompts Klein to reconsider his initial rate of two pence, deciding to increase it to eight pence to enhance his perceived expertise and mystique.

As Klein adjusts his pricing, Hanass Vincent announces the introduction of a new divination method: Magic Mirror Divination. This revelation prompts Klein to pause outside the classroom, concerned about the potential dangers associated with this form of divination. The chapter concludes with Klein's internal reflection on the new method and his decision to raise his rates, hinting at his growing confidence as a fortune-teller within the club.

#### Chapter 49: Divination Art

Klein Moretti finds himself learning about various divination arts. He understands that these can be categorized based on their source of revelation: the inquirer's spirituality, external entities, or orthodox divinities.

The first category includes methods like [[Tarot Cards]], [[Pendulum]]s, dowsing rods, and dream interpretation. These rely heavily on the inquirer's spiritual prowess and their connection to the spirit world. However, for non-Beyonders, precise revelations are challenging to obtain due to the stringent requirements of spirituality, Soul Body, and Astral Projection.

The second category encompasses Spirit Numerology, astromancy, and their derivatives. In this method, the fortune-teller uses calculations based on the inquirer's personal details or natural phenomena to provide answers. Here, the initiative lies with the fortune-tellers rather than the inquirers.

The third category involves external entities communicating directly through tools like Ouija boards. These methods are considered risky, often leading to tragic outcomes if average individuals attempt them, potentially inviting malicious spirits or entities causing insanity. 

Hanass Vincent introduces the magic mirror divination method, which falls under this third category. Mirrors symbolize connections to the unknown and spiritual worlds in mysticism. Klein hides outside the meeting room to learn about this forbidden practice, considering whether it warrants reporting to Captain Nathaniel.

Hanass explains that magic mirror divination involves choosing a suitable time based on the believed divinity, using a silver-coated mirror placed in a specific position related to lunar cycles. The fortune-teller must scrutinize the mirror carefully and pray sincerely to their chosen deity before breaking the mirror gently. The resulting patterns of shattered glass are interpreted as divine revelations.

Throughout the afternoon, members engage in discussions about horoscopes and magic mirror divination. Klein, as a [[Sequence 9 - Seer|Seer]], maintains a cautious approach, steering conversations away from Beyonder-related topics to avoid raising alarms among [[Nighthawks]]. Despite his efforts, no one selects him for fortune-telling, leading him to consider becoming more proactive in aquire clients.

Edward Steve encounters an old friend, Glacis, who appears unwell due to pneumonia, possibly exacerbated by a failed divination. Glacis, in a surprising turn, expresses intense interest in Klein Moretti, referring to him as "very, very magical... Doctor!" This comment hints at Klein's potent abilities and the potential risks associated with them, further underscoring the delicate balance Seers must maintain within the mystic society.

#### Chapter 50: Old Neil's Method of Repayment

Klein Moretti sits at the dining table with his siblings, [[Benson Moretti|Benson]] and [[Melissa Moretti|Melissa]], discussing financial matters. Klein explains his recent five-pound bonus from work, which he plans to use for personal purposes, including joining the Divination Club. This unexpected income causes a stir as it significantly surpasses their usual earnings.

Benson, the eldest sibling, expresses skepticism about Klein's ability to acquire such an amount through legitimate means, while Melissa trusts her brother implicitly. Klein, feeling a pang of guilt over his deception, justifies his actions by emphasizing their urgency and importance.

Benson suggests investing the extra money in improving his future prospects by studying accountancy and aiming for civil servant examinations, a growing trend in [[Loen Kingdom]]. Klein supports this idea, suggesting Benson read grammar books to enhance his writing skills—a prerequisite for such exams.

Melissa mentions an upcoming formal visit from their neighbor, Mrs. Shaud, whose husband is a senior solicitor. Klein, reminiscing about his previous life and current circumstances, humorously questions the need for structured neighborly visits. Benson explains that such practices are common among the middle class, who emulate aristocratic customs in an attempt to appear sophisticated without being ostentatious.

On the following Sunday, Klein prepares for Mrs. Shaud's visit by dressing appropriately—a half top hat and a silver-inlaid black cane. He takes a public carriage to Zouteland Street, where he works at the security company. Along the way, he encounters [[Sequence 9 - Sleepless|Sleepless]] Royale Reideen, a member of the [[Nighthawks]], who warns him about the dangers of [[Ritualistic Magic]].

Arriving at the basement office, Klein meets Old Neil, who informs him that they will perform a ritualistic magic session at his home in North Borough's suburbs due to space limitations in their current location. Upon reaching Old Neil's bungalow, filled with roses and other "ritual materials," Klein watches as Old Neil demonstrates the process of using ritualistic magic to settle debts—specifically, a thirty-pound debt—by drawing an IOU on specially prepared parchment.
