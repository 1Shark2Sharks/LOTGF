Roselle invented the steam engine, improved the sailing boat, overthrew the Intis Kingdom’s imperial rule, and was recognized by the God of Craftsmanship. He also became the first Consul of the Intis Republic.

Later, he invaded other nations and placed Lenburg and other nations under his protection. He made the [[Loen Kingdom]], [[Feynapotter]], [[Feysac|Feysac Empire]] and other powerful Northern Continent nations bow down to the Intis Republic. Following that, the Republic was then changed to an Empire and he became the self-proclaimed ‘Emperor Caesar.’

It was during Roselle’s rule that the Church of Craftsmanship received its first public holy revelation since the [[Fifth Epoch]]. Ever since, the God of Craftsmanship was changed to the God of Steam and Machinery.

Roselle also invented tarot [[Divination]]. He also established the contemporary system of paper-based cards and their playstyles.
