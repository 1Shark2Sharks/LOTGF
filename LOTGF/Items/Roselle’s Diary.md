### [[Chapters 21 - 30|Chapter 21]]

“**18th November.** Truly a fascinating matter. A blue-sky experimentation and a chance mistake made me discover the pathetic fellow lost and trapped in the deep darkness amid the storms. He can only approach the reality of this world on the day of the full moon every month; yet, he is unable to transmit his cries. He is lucky to have met me, the protagonist of this era  
  
“After reading the paragraph I wrote above, I suddenly felt a little down. Even my Chinese is written like a translation. Four decades have passed in a finger snap. My past memories feel more like a dream.”  
  
“**1184, 1st January.** At the grand New Year Gala, Lady Florena was truly splendid.”  
  
“**2nd January.** My diplomats are all idiots!”  
  
“**3rd January.** I made a hasty choice back then. In hindsight, I should have chosen the [[Sequence 9 - Apprentice|Apprentice]], the [[Sequence 9 - Seer|Seer]], or the [[Sequence 9 - Marauder|Marauder]]. Unfortunately, there is no way of redoing it.”  
  
“**4th January.** Why are my children so stupid? I’ve repeated myself so many times. Do not be fooled by those charlatans! The key thing about [[Beyonder Potions|potions]] is not about grasping them, but digesting them! It’s nothing about tapping powers, but [[Acting Method|acting]]. And the name of a potion is not solely symbolic at its core, but a concrete imagery, and the ‘key’ to [[Potion Digestion|digestion]]!”  
  
“**9th September.** An alliance opposing me has been established. [[Feysac]] from the north, [[Loen Kingdom|Loen]] from the east, [[Feynapotter]] from the south. My enemies have finally joined forces, but I have no fear. I will use facts to teach them that the generations of weapons and knowledge cannot be compensated by mere numbers and low-grade [[Sequences|Sequence]]rs. Besides, it’s not as though I do not have subordinates. As for the higher-grades, heh heh. Have they forgotten who I am?”  
  
“**23rd September.** I have lost communications with the ship seeking the [[Forsaken Land of the Gods]]. I should consider inventing wireless telegraphs. I hope it would not be affected by the storm.”  
  
“**24th September.** Miss Ithaca is more mesmerizing than Lady Florena. Perhaps, I’m just being nostalgic about my youth.”

  

### Chapter 59

“**8th April.** I stood at the bow of Black King and stretched my arms, saying to Grimm and Edwards, ‘My fortune is yours for the taking, but you’ll have to find it first. I left everything I own at the ends of the Fog Sea!’ They did not understand my humor at all and even asked if I really had other treasures. How boring. You can’t be my Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse if you keep at that!”  
  
“**April 11th.** I discovered a nameless island that was not on a safe sea route. There are a good number of extraordinary animals there, no—I prefer calling them extraordinary beings; it feels more impressive that way. Other than that, there are several weird creatures on the island. I believe that if Darwin had been transmigrated there, there is no way he could have written his Theory of Evolution.”  
  
“**April 15th.** Grimm has suddenly become a little odd. Has he been infected by something?”  
  
“**October 2nd.** They actually wanted me to marry Matilda from the Abel family without even consulting me first! Heavens, I have not even met her! No, I must decline! Even if I were to run away from home and survive on my own and suffer the vicissitudes of life, I must fight against this marriage!”  
  
“**October 5th.** Miss Matilda is really pretty.”  
  
“**October 6th.** Her personality and her demeanor is just my type. I am starting to look forward to the marriage.”  
  
“**October 9th.** They actually called me the Son of the Steam. I like that very much.”  
  
“**May 21st.** The [[Church of the God of Steam and Machinery|Church of the God of Craftsmanship]] gave me two choices, two beginning [[Sequences|Sequence]] [[Pathway|pathways]]. One of them is the [[Sequence 9 - Savant]]. It is a complete Sequence pathway they possess. The other is [[Sequence 9 - Mystery Pryer|Mystery Pryer]], which they obtained from the [[Moses Ascetic Order]], but it lacks the higher Sequences.”  
  
“**May 22nd.** My choice was easy: Savant! The Savant has a complete Sequence pathway! Although wielding more information on mysticism can aid my return home, the problem is that if I am not strong enough, there is a need to acquire external help for [[Transmigration]]. And I do not know if this external entity would be good or bad, benevolent or malicious. I cannot control it, and thus it could be very dangerous. In that case, why not strengthen myself and return by relying on my own powers? Thus, the complete Sequence was the most important factor in my considerations!”  
  
“**May 23rd.** I have become a Savant. With the power of the [[Beyonder Potions|potion]], I actually recalled all the knowledge I had learned in the past, such as physics, chemistry, etc…  
  
“I have not only recalled the knowledge, but I understand it more deeply, as well as its possible applications and implications. Haha, this is a ‘job’ specially tailored for a transmigrator like me from an alternate realm. I will be able to express my advantage to the greatest extent! I have to say that if I were to return in my present state to the third year of high school, I would definitely become top scholar. If I could further specialize in an area, it wouldn’t even be too hard for me to become a scientist.”  
  
“**May 26th.** I am enjoying my status as a Savant. Something odd worth mentioning. When I address myself as a Savant, doing things that are in line with this role, the murmurings that drive me crazy become considerably softer. I have also been able to control my occasional temper outbursts. I have also recalled the matter regarding the diary.  
“Is this the ‘acting’ that the mysterious Mr. [[Zaratul]] mentioned? This could be key in resolving the side effects posed by potions.”

  

### Chapter 93

“**July 9th.** I suddenly thought of an interesting question. Since the Sequence pathways are also called the ‘Blessings of The Divinities’ or ‘Pathways of The Divinities’, then why would the stone slate that records the completed twenty-two Sequence pathways be called the ‘[[Blasphemy Slate]]’. Blasphemy, what an interesting term… Just who is the one blasphemed?  
  
“And who created the Blasphemy Slate? How could that person hold all of the Sequence pathways? Just what other information was on the stone? I really want to see it…”  
  
“**July 12th.** I’ve realized another fact today. The [[Sealed Artifacts]] are an important component of a church’s overall strength, even though some of the sealed items are very, very dangerous. Among the [[Seven Orthodox Gods|seven churches]], the [[God of Steam and Machinery|God of Craftsmanship]] wields the least number of Sealed Artifacts which are also relatively less dangerous… Did I join an organization without a future? No, I should think of it this way; only a blank piece of paper can produce a good painting. A weak organization is the best place for me to display my abilities!  
  
“**July 14th.** I saw that mysterious Mr. Zaratul again. I never expected him to be the leader of an ancient organization, the [[Secret Order]]!”  
  
“After learning that I had become a Savant, Mr. Zaratul mentioned that I had chosen a difficult, yet relatively safe path. I asked him why that was the case, but all he did was smile before telling me that the Sequence pathway contains secrets beyond my imagination. I couldn’t help but ask him which Sequence pathway he selected. He told me that his Sequence 9 was [[Sequence 9 - Seer|Seer]].  
  
“I intentionally mocked him and asked if every Seer only disclosed half-truths, never explaining things more clearly. Furthermore, he was clearly a powerful High-Sequence Beyonder. There was no need for him to continue acting as a Seer!  
  
“Mr. Zaratul told me that it was a habit he adopted from back when he was a Seer, and that this was a method that could pique my curiosity and make me cooperate with him. He hoped that I could help him steal a dangerous sealed item from the Church of the God of Craftsmanship, a relic of the [[Antigonus Family]].  
  
“Clearly, this must wait until I become a core member of the Church of the God of Craftsmanship. I asked Mr. Zaratul how long it would take to digest the potion if I used the acting method, and what standards I should use to determine if I had digested it completely.  
  
“He told me that for the lower Sequences, it would only take half a year to digest the potion as long as one strictly used the acting method. In fact, in the fastest case, it might only take a month. And standard measure for progress was simple; every Beyonder would sense it immediately once the potion was completely digested. It is what it is.  
  
“I asked him for more details, but he merely smiled at me.  
  
“To hell with his smiles, I’ll beat up every Seer I see when I become a High-Sequence Beyonder!”
