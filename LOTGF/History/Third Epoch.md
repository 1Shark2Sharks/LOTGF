The [[Third Epoch]] was known as the Cataclysm Epoch, when Mother Earth and the God of War appeared, and humanity went through a major crisis. Humans were made from the Creator’s wisdom, which is why they lack strength. Instead, they took the powers of mythical creatures and put them in Beyonder potions, allowing them to harness “magic.” If high grade potions were consumed, there are 3 possible tragic outcomes. First, each part of their body would become a monster. Second, their personality will change to become more indifferent, cruel, etc. Third is “losing control,” where people become crazy and devilish.
